         <h1>What Am I Doing With My Life?</h1>
         <h3>My Coding Journey So Far</h3>
         <article id="past">
            <h1>Many Hats, No Head</h1>
            <p>Jack of all trades, master of... well most, to be honest. I was one of the 'gifted' kids growing up, meaning I 
               could recite my ABC's, did basic math, and exhibit critical thinking skills before kindergarten; so, I was told to skip it.
               This also means that from a young age, I had it in my head that things just came easily to me and that my supereriors would
               lay out paths for my life and career. Reality hits us hardest where we least expect it so, obviously, when that was inevitably 
               proven false my world seemed to collapse as all of the sudden I realized that I have no clue what I am going to do with my life!
            </p>
            <p>So began my jumping from one subject or field to the next and then to the next and... so on. I have done everything from delivering
               pizza to filming in Disney Studios to teaching Special Education to playing music in salsa clubs on a school night. Name it, I 
               have probably done it at least once! The void that opened when I was forced to actually make a choice about my life seemed to always
               be 'just one more skill' away from finally being filled. So I bounced from one job to the next, getting pretty darn good at most of them, 
               until I finally settled on a career choice: Band Director.
            </p>
            <p>I worked my tail off to become the best educator I could be, not only in music, but in life in general. I had a very poor music teacher in
               high school that inspired me to become an educator on the exact, opposite end of the spectrum from him. Still playing in clubs and marching 
               in professional marching groups, it seemed like a good choice for me. Fast forward a few years and I relocated from Sunny California to the 
               beautiful greenery (AND CORN LOTS OF CORN) of the midwest to attend McKendree University and pursue my Bachelor's in Music Ed. Finally, I had 
               nailed down a career path and it was something I was good at! Well... I never finished. I paid for school myself using tip money from
               bartending while teaching at a number of highschools' afterschool percussion programs AND tutored at the local library. My closet had
               no room for all the hats I was wearing. Until, I got burnt out. I began to resent the school system and how it worked, and I
               had already been doing exactly what I was going to school for. Why am I paying $5k out of pocket per semester? Long story short
               I dropped out, and met my fiance who further flipped my world upside down when she gave me our daughter. Since then, I have worn my
               favorite hat: Dad.
            </p>

         <article id="present">
            <h1>Where Am I Now?</h1>
            <p>Now-a-days, I wear the Dad hat mostly and take care of my family's home. My fiance and I started a coffee shop in the Metro East
               area of Southern Illinois and we ran that for about two years. Unfortunately, we were one of the business casualties that occurred
               in the aftermath of Covid-19 and the resulting economic storms. We closed in August of this year and are now off to the next thing! (hint: It's coding.)
            </p>
            <p>I found coding initially through freeCodeCamp.org, which is a FANTASTIC program that easily outlines coding basics through interactive tutorials
               FOOOOOR FREEEEE! I enjoyed what I felt was essentially a new language and all the applications of it. After building a few 
               static webpages I started another coding tutorial by the name of The Odin Project. This was very similar to freeCodeCamp but 
               more focused on Javascript. I found it very resourceful and HEAVILY supported by its own development community. There I built
               different basic apps such as an Etch-A-Sketch, Tic-Tac-Toe, and a Calculator. When I reached the middle point of that course,
               I found LaunchCode and decided to apply!
            </p>
            <p>And here I am! I have learned a metric-buttload (to use a scientific term) of coding and have even secured a few 
               small clients for my freelance webdev practice. I knew a lot of what LaunchCode had to teach in the beginning but it was
               very nice to step back and get down to basic concepts again and now our course work is starting to get to concepts I have
               never heard of before! It is all very exciting and at the same time mind numbing. Thankfully we have each other and a great 
               set of TA's and other faculty to help us through it, many of which I have already contacted for help.

            <h1>Here's Where I Am Going</h1>
            <p>So now what!? I have a new skill I am honing, but what am I wanting to do with it? Freelancing has given me a lot of great 
               opportunities to practice front-end development and that itself has exposed some holes in my education. Like, DESIGN! I have 
               learned that when it comes to implementing a design, I am pretty proficient. BUT DO NOT ASK ME TO DESIGN ANYTHING FOR YOU!! (yet).
            </p>
            <p>So that's where I am heading next. I am finishing up the coding details with LaunchCode and hope to further my professional
               career with the help of this program. In the mean time, I am studying anything to do with modern web design practices. I am 
               beyond blessed to have a few working clients who understand where I am in my journey and that I can test design practices on
               without losing my job!
            </p>
            <p>In addition to working on my design skills, I am finally putting my own portfolio together. This is a big deal for me since most
               of the time when looking at job listings, I would get intimidated by the extensive stacks required for the position. So intimidated
               that I wouldn't even put my projects together in a portfolio because they would never be 'good enough.' Well, I am a lot more
               confident in my abilites now and that will be my next big project. Lately, I have been scrolling through job listings and have been
               missing that daunting feeling which has been replaced by a renewed sense of confidence and general "I got this"-ness. My hope is 
               that in the next few months I will have landed an entry level position where I can further my skills under mentorship in real world
               application. Wish me luck!
